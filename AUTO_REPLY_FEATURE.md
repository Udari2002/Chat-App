# Auto-Reply Feature Explanation

## ðŸ¤– How Auto-Reply Works

### **What Triggers Auto-Reply:**
When you send a message, the system checks if it matches certain keywords and automatically responds:

1. **"hi"** â†’ Replies: "Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ How are you doing today?"
2. **"hello"** â†’ Replies: "Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ How are you doing today?"
3. **"hey"** â†’ Replies: "Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ How are you doing today?"
4. **"how are you"** â†’ Replies: "I'm doing great, thanks for asking! ðŸ˜Š How about you?"
5. **"bye"** â†’ Replies: "Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹ Have a great day!"
6. **"thank"** â†’ Replies: "You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š"
7. **"name"** â†’ Replies: "My name is [User Name]! Nice to meet you!"
8. **"help"** â†’ Replies: "I can chat with you, respond to greetings, and help you with basic conversation! ðŸ¤–"

### **How It Works:**

1. **Message Detection**: When you send a message, the system checks if it contains trigger words
2. **Auto-Reply Generation**: If a match is found, it generates an appropriate response
3. **Natural Delay**: The reply is sent after a 1-3 second delay to feel more natural
4. **Message Display**: The auto-reply appears as if the other user sent it

### **Technical Implementation:**

```javascript
// Auto-reply function
const generateAutoReply = (message) => {
  const lowerMessage = message.toLowerCase().trim();
  
  if (lowerMessage === 'hi' || lowerMessage === 'hello' || lowerMessage === 'hey') {
    return "Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ How are you doing today?";
  }
  // ... more conditions
};

// Send auto-reply with delay
const autoReply = generateAutoReply(messageText);
if (autoReply) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    sendAutoReply(autoReply);
  }, 1000 + Math.random() * 2000); // Random delay 1-3 seconds
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Instructions

### **To Test Auto-Reply:**

2. **Send "hi"** - You'll get an auto-reply after 1-3 seconds
3. **Try other triggers** like "hello", "how are you", "bye", etc.
4. **Watch the natural delay** - replies don't come instantly
